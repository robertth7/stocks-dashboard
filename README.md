# stocks-dashboard

Stocks-Dashboard is an application that allows you to view and store your favorite stock into a list.
It will allow you to view its current price and more.

AS A stock exchange learner I WANT to see stock prices for multiple companies SO THAT I can buy stock. 

GIVEN a stock exchange dashboard with form inputs WHEN I search for a company THEN I am presented with past and current information about the company and can be added to a watch list. WHEN I view current information on the company THEN I am presented with the Company Name, Symbol, Logo, Hi & Low of the day, and news. WHEN I click on a company on my watch list THEN I am presented all the information again.
